This repository explores the vertical integration of computer systems. I am documenting the process of bridging the gap between high-level abstractions and the physical implementation of a 16-bit computer. Building a CPU from NAND gates to a working system.

Most modern development treats the execution environment as a "black box". My objective here is to deconstruct that box. By starting with a single primitive logic gate, I am incrementally synthesizing a complete machine capable of running high-level applications.
